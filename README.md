# Crawling-Study
This is a simple crawling study that obtained the new houses for sale in Wuhan, China.
The used programming language was Go. As a beginner, I used package "http" to request the website information and "regexp" to search for the key data that I wanted.
I think it's useful to have a good understanding for web develop and information crawling from the simple example. Afterwards, we can use some advanced frameworks like beego or colly to fast programme and build the total structures, which is still a good way to go.
